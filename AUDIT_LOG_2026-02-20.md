# Project Audit Log - 2026-02-20

## Overview
Today's focus was on transforming the Provident Deansgate landing page from a placeholder-based UI to a high-fidelity experience using real project images and enhanced component layouts.

## Activity Summary

### 1. Image Asset Integration
- Migrated from generic placeholders to real assets located in `/public/images/`.
- Mapped specific "page_img" assets to relevant sections (Hero, About, Amenities, Highlights, CTA, Location).

### 2. Component Enhancements

#### Amenities Section
- **File**: `src/components/Amenities.jsx`
- **Changes**: Replaced all 6 placeholder icons/images with real site photographs (`page19_img4`, `page20_img1`, etc.).

#### Highlights Section
- **File**: `src/components/Highlights.jsx`, `src/components/Highlights.css`
- **Changes**: 
  - Integrated visual cards for the "Numbers That Matter" section.
  - Added project images (`page11_img1-5`) to each highlight card.
  - Implemented responsive image container styles.

#### Location Section
- **File**: `src/components/Location.jsx`, `src/components/Location.css`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added a new `location__feature-image` using `page15_img1.jpeg`.
  - Updated layout to prioritize visual proximity alongside the Google Maps integration.

#### CTA Section
- **File**: `src/components/CTA.css`
- **Changes**: Updated background to `page16_img1.jpeg` for a more dramatic call-to-action section.

### 3. Documentation & Verification
- Created `implementation_plan.md` for user approval.
- Created `task.md` for progress tracking.
- Created `walkthrough.md` for final validation of changes.
- Verified all image paths and ensured responsive behavior across viewports.

## Status
**Completed**. All landing page sections now reflect real project imagery.
